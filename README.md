# Takehome - Frontend

## Intro
Thank you for your interest in DefinitelyNotSpruce!
As part of our interview process, we ask our candidates to do a simple take-home coding challenge.
Please create a front-end application that does the following:

## Requirements

### Required
- Should match the attached mockups
- Should support displaying two types of bookings
  - Housekeeping
  - Dog walks
- Should use a modern JS framework (we use React, but use whatever is most comfortable for you)
- Use whatever additional libraries you deem appropriate
- Should list bookings in ascending order by date

### Optional
- Add pagination (5 items per page)
- Add the ability to filter by booking type
- Add unit tests



###Setup

### Dependencies

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Configuration

Install all dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```
Booking information will be provided via a RESTful API. The project calls endpoints in "https://bookingapi-b86e.restdb.io/rest/bookings". You run it locally by pointing to a local instance of bookings. 

#### Compilation

We have a compilation script that can be run with the following command:

```
$ npm run start
```

This makes webpack compilate the project on port 3000.
